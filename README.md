# Talking Scripts
These are various scripts I've made using the [Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsspeechsynthesizer) 
interface for the voice synthesizer libraries in macOS

Script | Function 
-----: | :------- 
`allVoicesSpeak.py` | Takes a given string argument and reads it in every voice
`copypasta.py` | Recites a Computer Science version of the Navy Seal copypasta **explicit**
`speech.py` | Takes a given string argument and reads it in the stock voice
`weAreLegion.py` | Each voice in the library introduces itself by saying "My name is _____"
